            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Snyder Tree Removal is a family business owned and operated by brothers David and Luke Snyder. Growing up on a dairy farm, we developed a strong work ethic that we now bring to every tree care project.
              <br /><br />
              Trained and certified by Arboriculture Canada, we have the expertise and equipment to handle jobs of any sizeâ€”from complete tree removal to trimming, storm cleanup, chipping, and stump grinding.
              <br /><br />
              Our business is built on traditional values of hard work, reliability, and respect. At Snyder Tree Removal, we are committed to meeting your needs and providing peace of mind throughout the process.
            </p>
